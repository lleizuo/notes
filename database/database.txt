Chapter 1 Introduction

Data
	Some values referring to real world facts.
	May be in various formats, e.g., text, image, audio file, video file, etc.

Database

File system vs DBMS
	In the early days, application programs were built on top of file systems. (e.g., DOS, Windows file explorer)
	6 drawbacks of storing DB in file systems
		1.Difficulty in accessing data - May be inefficient to locate a piece of information.
		2.Data redundancy and inconsistency - Data got updated in one place but forget to update the other one.
		3.Data isolation - Because data are scattered in various files, and files may be in different formats, writing new programs to retrieve the appropriate data is difficult.
