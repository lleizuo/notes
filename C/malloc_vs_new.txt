Differences between malloc and new:

1. Calling Constructors: 
new calls constructors, while malloc() does not. 
In fact primitive data types (char, int, float.. etc) can also be initialized with new. 
For example, below program prints 10.

#include<iostream> 
  
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
   int *n = new int(10); // initialization with new() 
   cout << *n; 
   getchar(); 
   return 0; 
} 

2.operator vs function: new is an operator, while malloc() is a function.

3.return type: new returns exact data type, while malloc() returns void *.

4.Failure Condition: On failure, malloc() returns NULL where as new Throws.

5.Memory: In case of new, memory is allocated from free store where as in malloc() memory allocation is done from heap.

6.Overriding: We are allowed to override new operator where as we can not override the malloc() function legally.

7.Size: Required size of memory is calculated by compiler for new, where as we have to manually calculate size for malloc().
