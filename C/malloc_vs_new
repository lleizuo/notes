Differences between malloc and new:

1. Calling Constructors: 
new calls constructors, while malloc() does not. 
In fact primitive data types (char, int, float.. etc) can also be initialized with new. 
For example, below program prints 10.

#include<iostream> 
  
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
   int *n = new int(10); // initialization with new() 
   cout << *n; 
   getchar(); 
   return 0; 
}
