first element is always the greatest
similar to a heap
Priority queues are implemented as container adaptors, 
which are classes that use an encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, (底层容器)
providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements. 
Elements are popped from the "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the priority queue.
