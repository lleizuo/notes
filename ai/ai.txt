Chapter 1 Search
Abstraction
	Search problems are models
		Simplifications of the real world
		Don't deal with the unnecessary complexities of the real world
Types of Search
	Uninformed search
		No information about the problem other than its definition is given
	Informed search
		A heuristic is used that leads to better overall performance in getting to the goal state
	Local Search
		Evaluate and modify a current state to move closer to a goal state
	Constraint Satisfaction Problems
		For certain types of problems we can search for solution faster by understanding states better
	Adversarial Search
		Search in the presence of an adversary 对手
Search Problem Definition
	States:Details of what constitutes a state
	Initial state: The state the agent starts in
	Actions and transition model
		Description of possible actions available
		Description of what each action does
	Goal test
	Path cost: A function that assigns a zero or positive numeric cost to each path
	A solution is a sequence of actions (a plan) which transforms the start state to a goal state.
